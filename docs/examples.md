The development environments outlined in the previous section include a host of built-in examples to get started working with the Pro Micro - RP2350. In this section, we'll go over how to set up and use the assembly outlined in the Hardware Assembly section to use an Arducam with the Pro Micro - RP2350.

## Arducam PSRAM Example

### Software Requirements

This example uses the Pico SDK, Arducam's Pico Cam driver for the SDK. Users will need to install the Arducam driver following the instructions in the [Pico SPI Cam GitHub Repo](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk) prior to compiling and uploading the example code. The example also uses a Processing sketch to take the images from the Pro Micro and displays them on your computer screen.

We've included pretty much everything you'll need to run the example in the Pro Micro - RP2350 GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_Pro_Micro_RP2350/tree/main/Examples/Arducam_Demo).
