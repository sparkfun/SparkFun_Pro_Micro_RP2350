Getting started with the Pro Micro - RP2350 is as easy as plugging it in over USB. The board ships with simple code that cycles the WS2812 RGB LED through a rainbow so on initial power up you should see that cycle.

From here, you can quickly get started programming the board with either the Pico SDK or MicroPython. If you'd like to quickly get started with a variety of I<sup>2</sup>C devices, SparkFun carries a variety of Qwiic boards with MicroPython support such as the [Optical Tracking Odometry Sensor](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/24904) as shown in the assembly photo below:
